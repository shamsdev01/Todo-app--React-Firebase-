# React Firebase Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built using React and Firebase. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application uses Firebase to store and sync data in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Sync:** The app leverages Firebase's real-time database to ensure that changes made by one user are instantly reflected for others.

- **User Authentication:** Firebase authentication is integrated to allow users to sign in and manage their individual todo lists securely.

- **CRUD Operations:** Users can add, edit, and delete tasks. The changes are immediately updated in the Firebase database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Firebase account and a new project created in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Todo-app--React-Firebase.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-firebase-todo
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up Firebase configuration:

    - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    - Obtain your Firebase configuration from the Firebase Console (`Settings > Project settings > Your apps > Firebase SDK snippet`) and add the following to your `.env` file:

        ```env
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
        ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Firebase Configuration

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project if you haven't already.
3. In the project dashboard, navigate to "Authentication" and set up your preferred authentication method.
4. In the project dashboard, navigate to "Database" and create a new Realtime Database.
5. Set up the database rules to secure your data according to your requirements.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your web browser (`http://localhost:3000` by default).
2. Sign in using your Firebase authentication method.
3. Add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Deployment

To deploy the app, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized and minified files. You can then deploy this directory to your preferred hosting platform.
